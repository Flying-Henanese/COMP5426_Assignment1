The collapse of a set of integers indicates the sum of all integers in the set, while the collapse of a single integer is the sum of all its digits.
For the purpose of acquiring the ultimate collapse of an integer, which is a single digit, we should do the calculation recursively. In other words, we shall implement this procedure step by step, process the result of previous calculation, till we get a result as a single digit.
